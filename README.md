# Spring Boot Auth Start

This is a simple Spring Boot app that adds Authentication using JWT, login, signup, global exception handling and can easily be started up with a simple docker-compose up command.

The idea behind this app is someone can use it as a base to build ontop of. Not having to worry about adding security yourself.
